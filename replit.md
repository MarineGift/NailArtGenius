- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Authentication**: Replit's built-in OpenID Connect authentication system
- **Payment Processing**: PayPal SDK integration for secure transactions
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for nail shape analysis and image generation
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS styling

### Deployment Strategy
- **Development**: Uses Vite dev server with HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
- **Production**: Static files served by Express with esbuild bundling
- **Database**: Configured for Neon PostgreSQL with connection pooling
- **Environment**: Designed for Replit hosting with specific environment variable handling

## Key Components

### Frontend Architecture
- **Router**: Wouter for client-side routing with conditional authentication flows
- **State Management**: TanStack Query for server state and caching
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom Shadcn/ui styling
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS custom properties for theming

### Backend Architecture
- **API Structure**: RESTful endpoints organized by feature (auth, photos, designs, orders, payments)
- **Middleware**: Express session management, request logging, and error handling
- **File Upload**: Multer for handling image uploads with disk storage
- **Database Layer**: Drizzle ORM with connection pooling for PostgreSQL

### Authentication Flow
- **Replit Auth**: Integrated OpenID Connect with automatic user session management
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions with connect-pg-simple
- **Route Protection**: Middleware-based authentication checks for protected endpoints

### Advanced AI Integration
- **Image Analysis**: OpenAI Vision API for analyzing uploaded nail photos with card-based scale reference
- **Precise Measurement**: 6-photo nail measurement system using standard credit card dimensions (85.60mm x 53.98mm x 0.76mm)
- **Advanced Design Generation**: Multi-layered AI system with comprehensive style preferences
- **Personality-Based Customization**: AI considers user personality traits, lifestyle, and inspiration keywords
- **Design Variations**: Automated generation of multiple design alternatives with different intensity levels
- **Smart Recommendations**: AI analysis providing personalized suggestions based on nail measurements and preferences

## Data Flow

### User Journey
1. **Authentication**: Users authenticate via Replit's OAuth system
2. **Photo Upload**: Multiple finger photos uploaded and stored locally
3. **AI Processing**: Photos analyzed by OpenAI for shape and dimension data
4. **Design Selection**: Users choose from curated nail art designs
5. **Payment**: PayPal integration handles secure payment processing
6. **Order Tracking**: Real-time order status updates and printing queue management

### Database Schema
- **Users**: Replit user profiles with extended metadata
- **Customer Photos**: Uploaded images with finger type and analysis metadata
- **AI Generated Nails**: Results from AI analysis with shape measurements
- **Nail Designs**: Curated design catalog with pricing and categories
- **Orders**: Complete order records linking users, designs, and payment status
- **Sessions**: Secure session storage required for Replit authentication

## External Dependencies

### Core Services
- **Replit Authentication**: Mandatory OIDC integration for user management
- **Neon Database**: PostgreSQL hosting with serverless connection pooling
- **OpenAI API**: Vision and completion models for nail analysis
- **PayPal SDK**: Payment processing with sandbox/production environment switching

### Development Tools
- **Vite**: Frontend build tool with React plugin and custom configuration
- **Drizzle Kit**: Database migration and schema management
- **TypeScript**: Full-stack type safety with shared schema definitions
- **ESBuild**: Production bundling for backend code

### UI/UX Libraries
- **Radix UI**: Accessible component primitives for complex interactions
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with custom design system
- **Lucide React**: Consistent icon library throughout the application
- **React Hook Form**: Form state management with validation

## Development Strategy

### Environment Setup
- Database requires `DATABASE_URL` environment variable for Neon PostgreSQL
- OpenAI integration needs `OPENAI_API_KEY` for AI functionality
- PayPal requires `PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID` and `PAYPAL_CLIENT_SECRET`
- Replit authentication requires `REPLIT_DOMAINS` and session configuration

### Code Organization
- **Shared Types**: Common TypeScript definitions in `/shared/schema.ts`
- **Client Code**: React application in `/client/src/` with component-based structure
- **Server Code**: Express API in `/server/` with feature-based route organization
- **Database**: Drizzle schema and migrations with type-safe query building

### Critical Integration Points
- **PayPal Code**: Marked sections must not be modified to maintain payment functionality
- **Replit Auth**: User operations in storage layer are mandatory for authentication
- **Session Management**: PostgreSQL sessions table required for Replit auth compliance
- **File Uploads**: Local disk storage with organized directory structure for user photos
